"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Mike C.","Very good food
Crab cakes were amazing gourmet
The Philly cheese was very tender and juicy"
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Michelle M.","We've come here a few times, once during happy hour and then once during dinner service on the weekend. Both times, the food has been delicious, perfectly priced, and served with a lot of heart.
I recommend both the Philly Dip and the Steak and Baked Fries.
Happy hour menu is great!"
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Kim W.","Came in for a Seahawks game
Pros:
Great for groups, lots of space and doesn't get too crowded which I like. Our server Andrew was amazing and really went out of his way to give us great service.
Cons:
Apparently they released a new menu the day before we came and boy if I knew I would NOT have come here. Way over priced for the type of food you get, basic bar food at restaurant prices. I was planning on coming and getting food all afternoon for the game but fries alone were almost 10$ after tax. Way way way overpriced for what food you get. My group ordered wings (which were good), nachos (alright), backyard burger (burnt) and drinks for each of us. Our bill was over $100. Somethings off if they think this will bring people in."
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Eric O.","Love the restaurant interior, staff is friendly, and drink options are plentiful. Some cons for me were pricy food items, small portions, and TVs mounted too high. I got to the eatery about 30 minutes after they opened. There were only two others in the restaurant. The bartender chatted up all the patrons and was so nice to interact with. Food came out quickly and the plates were properly warmed. I was impressed that the place had large screen TVs all around each wall of the space which was great. My only gripe was they were mounted close to the ceiling. So Monday Night Football was on the screen in front of me at the bar and I had to strain my neck a little. All in all a decent spot. I really want to rate this higher, but with the prices/portion ratio is a bit off. I will visit again when there are more patrons. Would like to see service with more people in the spot"
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Mike H.","Let start off by saying WOW, just WOW!! I have never had a steak salad before and i never knew what i was missing until now. I order the black and blue salad. The salad itself was large and had a good portion of steak on it. The salad was fresh and so were all the toppings. The steak was seasoned perfectly and was cooked perfectly. Medium rare to medium. The dressing the salad dressing that came with the salad brought all the flavors together and really set the salad off. I can go on record and say that this is by far one of the best salads that i have ever had. My friends order a Cajun Chicken sandwich and they said that it was delicious as well. I have passed by this place so many times I'm glad i went in and will have to go back."
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Amira J.","first of all, our server mike was so cool n sweet! authentically himself & laid back! he checked on our group often & made sure our water was refilled! it can be hard to feel welcomed by some restaurants especially if you are a black person of color so i just want to say my experience here with the service was amazing!
i met up with my folks here after work around 6. the pub is located at the end of a small lot that's shared with a gas station & a few other small stores. when you walk in it's pretty spacious inside. not really booths but lots of tables n chairs & a bar.
i ordered the large cajun chicken cesar salad 5/5: i was really excited about eating this. the portion of chicken was perfect with the amount of lettuce given. it came with parmesan, & croutons! the dressing wasn't heavy at all & i appreciated this because i was able to feel more refreshed after chowin dooown
overall i had a great experience here & would 100% recommend for happy hour & late dining.
happy hour is from 3-6, 9-close"
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Kristy R.","Second time visiting here. The outside looks a little sketchy but inside has a cool vibe! There is parking in the back in case it is completely full in the little area in front. We did not order any food at this visit but did on our last. Food is very good and service is even better! Enjoyed a couple cocktails tonight and listen to live music definitely a cool little joint. The area it's located in is not my favorite though."
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Amber Lee A.","Good food, in a location you wouldn't expect. I drove up to meet a friend and just assumed it was a gas station. I've now been twice and all the items I have tried were very good."
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Lena Y.","Kind of a hidden gem in a strip mall within a gas station. I found this place via a quick Yelp search so my friend and I could grab dinner. It doesn't look very big from the outside, but you walk into a pretty large space with a variety of tables and seating areas. We sat ourselves as a sign instructed us to, and we were greeted by our server Mike. He was friendly, welcoming and energetic. We shared the poutine, and I got the Hellbent coconut stout and backyard burger with a side of broccoli cheddar soup. Cool that all there beers on tap are from Washington!"
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Chelsi A.","Don't judge a book by its cover. I honestly thought it was a small old bar, and if it wasn't for my cousin recommendation I'm not sure we would have gone.
I love the atmosphere, great selection of local beers on tap and DELICIOUS pulled pork nachos; oh man!! I grew up in Renton and will know recommend this place to everyone. We will for sure be back."
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Henry L.","Came here on a Sunday night with a few friends. It's was around 8pm.
Place was pretty slow with a couple other patrons. Server was welcoming and pretty cool. We had a table by the window. There was a lot of space.
I had a cocktail called Rob Roy. It was average.
Appetizer was crab cakes. It was surprisingly a lot. Came with 2 patties the size of a bk whopper.
Entree was was seared ahi tuna. It was decent. Tuna tasted fresh. Visually, it looked pretty light. But it got me pretty full. Maybe because the crab cakes were so huge. Overall, I can't give too many points for vibes, since it was a Sunday night. Flavors for pretty average, but quality of ingredients keep it above average. I'd say if you're looking for a chill place to have a conversation, this is a good place. If you're a flavor hunter, it's pretty average."
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Mike S.","Food was good, beers were cold service was a bit slow but it all worked out. Good atmosphere, friendly staff, fair food portions. Good place to chill."
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Deanna D.","This is the 3rd time I've been here, and I love it! Very personable wait staff, great food selection, and our waiter was charismatic, and very attentive. We had the Brick Philly Dip, and the Black & Blue salad."
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Leslie W.","The Brick recently changed their menu again. I miss the Cajun chicken sandwich. I only eat white meat and was glad to have this on the menu. The have since removed it. I asked the server if I could have the chicken sandwich from the old menu and he said yes. WHoooHOOOO. Unfortunately when it came out it is not the same sandwich. It is sliced chicken on a bun. This does not make a good sandwich. The pieces kept falling out of the bread. It was a horrible way to eat. The original was the reason I came to the brick repeatedly. Since that sandwich is gone I don't find anything comparable on the menu. Guess I will have to find another Cajun chicken somewhere else."
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Stephen G.","Our second visit to the Brick Pub. First visit a few months back was not bad.
It took at least 15 minutes for the waiter to come to our table. We ordered drinks and dinner. It took around another 10 minutes for the waiter to bring the drinks over. She was doubling as a bartender too. It took around 40 more minutes to get our food...that's almost an hour since we got there. Not acceptable. Fish from fish and chips was over fried and hard. My wife's flank steak order was sirloin tip according to her, and it was pink on the inside though she ordered it medium well.
All in all, we were pretty disappointed..."
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Brad B.","The Brick is a nice pub with great food, hiding in a gas station parking lot. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but the inside is large with lots of seating.
I loved the beer selection at the Brick. They had a whole bunch of local beers that you don't find at many other places, which that alone would keep me coming back.
The food was really good as well! I had a grilled cheese with bacon and peppers and it was awesome! I think it was about $12 which is reasonable.
They also have games out for customers to play, which is always fun when drinking beer with your friends."
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Koren C.","Best dang pork chop I've ever had!
From the outside it looks a little sketchy, but this was a VERY good restaurant! A must try!!
Great beers, good happy hour, even better food!
Thanks "" the brick"""
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Senor C.","This place was SO good. The owner is really cool and the music is always fun.
With that said...
I have now had three bad meals in a row and I am ready to stop trying. That is big bucks I will never get back. How do you screw up a BLT? The bacon was so overcooked that it was more like burnt bacon dust than meat. The ""Philly cheese steak"" was not good and didn't even come with the advertised aioli sauce. My fries sucked and were cold. How on Earth can you make a bad cheese steak? I don't even remember what they screwed up before that but I still remember the dissapointment coupled with a 70 dollar check.
I have had everything on the menu in the past and it ALL used to be good.
Now, I am afraid to order anything.
I sure hope they fix it back to the way it was. There is nothing like this place in the highlands."
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Rich L.","Just wanted to thank the blonde haired girl and bearded guy working tonight for showing racism. We walked in approx 30 mins ago and sat down at the table next to the bar. No acknowledgement even though both of them looked straight at us. Blonde girl started cleaning one of the machines and the bearded guy just kept talking to his friends. We sat the table for 15 mins and neither of them brought a menu or said Hi to us. After I began staring at the girl wondering why we were being ignored, a white couple came in and sat at the bar. Within 30 seconds he had poured them waters and took their order. He made their drinks and we had yet to be greeted or brought a drink menu. Every person in the bar was white including the couple that came in. Coincidence??? Thank you for ruining our evening and reaffirming that asian people are not welcome at the pub."
"The Brick Pub & Grill","(425) 207-8951","Andrea I.","We found this gem on Yelp, and another fantastic find it was. It has local beer on tap that my husband really liked and I had a ""Fru-Fru"" drink the Lavender Mule which was amazing. As if the great drinks weren't enough the food was just as amazing. Ordered the Pastrami Melt and it was some of the best tasting pastrami I have had.
The waitress was very informative and helpful, she knew her products and had answers to all our our questions.
This place is quite a find and it is worth the visit."
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Ran L.","True to its name, this place serves up a mean sandwich! There are good restaurants, and then there are restaurants whose food is worthy of random cravings that could happen on any day at any time. Mean sandwich falls squarely in the latter category for me.
The Midnight At the Oasis, the falafel-based sandwich, is one of the best vegan sandwiches I've had anywhere. It simply can't be beet ;)
The chicken cutlet sandwich is SO delicious - it's the one I crave the most when I think of Mean Sandwich.
I've also had one bite of my friend's fish sandwich, which I found to be tasty with inventive flavors.
I'm not a huge fan of the potato skins and ins - I find them to be too crisp and browned for my tastes, but that won't keep me from coming back for the sandwiches (I do wish they offered an additional side dish option or two, though)!"
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Jean K.","We snuck into Mean Sandwich just before they were going to close for Thanksgiving week. So lucky us. Unluckily they were doing a fried chicken pop-up that same day and it was bonkers inside with lots of people and orders backed up in the kitchen. They did offer to send our food to the brewery next door if we chose to wait there instead but we decided to walk around the neighborhood and come back.
We ordered the steak tartare club and a side of salt and pepper 'skins and ins. It took about 35 minutes for our food. The steak tartare is labor intensive so due to the rush they were batching them as orders came in I think.
Worth it though! What an incredible idea to substitute steak tartare in spicy yuzu mayo for the T in the BLT. And with chewy dense rye bread. The sandwich doesn't look like much but I recommend sharing if you want to include a generous helping of skins as well.
Speaking of which, why has no one else thought about deep frying potato skins? Wonderfully salty, peppery, crispy with yummy soft potato insides. Dangerously addictive and filling. Goes great with beer :-).
Definitely want to come back and try the Midnight at the Oasis next time we're in town."
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Ahmed F.","Such a great spot!
The burger here is smashed to perfection with very crispy sides and juicy throughout. I'm not a fan of mustard or raw onions on a burger but boy, do they go well with this burger at Mean Sandwich. I'm a fan!
The ""fries"" are not really fries but fried potatoes with skin. I suspect they're baked first and then fried later: Whatever they do with them, they're quite magical :) Crispy skins with the meaty center in that spud.
If you've been to any Fredy's Steakhouse chain location, this is an elevated version of that kind of a burger.
I had a chat with the staff present and they were really friendly and engaging in conversation.
Can't wait to be back for more!"
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Heather W.","Case of ordering wrong? Not sure. We actually made a u-turn to hit up this place to grab some lunch to go for our road trip up north. I always trust a local fav from yelp and the amount of patrons waiting for food further supported that. However, the combination of super long wait, high price and lackluster sandwiches have left me feeling a bit bitter abouts things.
I ordered the Buon Appetito (chicken cutlet sandwich) and the Jersey Sub (Italian sub) which are both $12. I thought it would be a quick process but the shop is small and it was very busy with orders going one at a time. It seemed like there was a combo of 4 or 5 people in the place ahead of me and who knows how many remote ordering. Pro tip (apparently) order ahead for pickup. I think my wait for 2 sandwiches was at least 25 mins.
Out of the 2, the Buon appetito was better, but still mediocre. But the Jersey was just plain bad. Whatever sub roll bread is used tasted like cheap white bread and was probably the primary reason it tasted badly... bread is important. It was just really plain tasting. I hate feeling so strongly on this but for nearly $30 for 2 sandwiches and being in a hurry, this visit was a big mistake and I should have just gotten sandwiches at Safeway for half the price."
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Maddy L.","Yay I am a fan! The Mean Sandwich is right next to a brewery, so you can take your food and go over there! The time we waited took a while, but the food is fair priced and very good. I got the italian sandwich and my friend got the med - both very delicious. The potatoes are also very good (highly rec the buffalo ones!!)"
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Morgan J.","The buon appetito sandwich, which is a fried chicken sandwich, was lackluster IMO. There wasn't much flavor and there was way too much bread and not enough chicken. I asked for a side of pickles to jazz it up. The menu is heavy on meats, slaws, pickled stuff, and buffalo sauce, which is not my personal fave but many others will love.
On the bright side, this place is dog friendly with a huge patio out back including ping pong and cornhole! It would be a great place to go with a group of friends. We went at a weird time, like 4 pm on a Thursday, and there was no one else there!"
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Samer K.","The grub hub driver lied about picking up my order but I thought it was super thoughtful for the Mean Sandwich staff to contact me and let me know about this issue because I didn't know and just thought food was on the way. Great customer service"
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Vijay S.","Had a mean sandwich (corned beef, cabbage, mustard, mint and maple syrup) with falafel added - was such a great sandwich. They source their meats locally, make their own falafel (really good) and are just the type of place you would want to go to after a few brews (or even pick up a sandwich at lunch)
Highly recommend."
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Alyssa M.","Love this place. Went for the first time today with my dog and the owner came out to the patio to say hi, give my dog (Scout) some love, and thank us for coming in. Really friendly guy, it's always nice to know the people behind a local businesses.
I had the falafel sandwich and it was bomb. The pickles on it had a great tang to balance out the falafel. It was definitely Scout-Approved and we will be back!"
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Maggie R.","Oyster po'boy was amazing. I had it with a pilsner, which enhanced the experience. My family and I came here after visiting the Nordic Museum, and I'm glad we did. Initially we were going to go to the brewery next door after ordering sandwiches, but they were closed that day. Turns out that was OK, because we still got good beer with our sandwiches. The po'boy was slightly spicy, which I thought was delicious. It was a generous size, so I left feeling satisfied and refreshed. The space isn't exactly what I'd call ""comfortable,"" but that's OK because I was focused on the FOOD. Plus, they had puppy videos playing on the large TV in the corner. Who knew there was a channel dedicated to adorable pets? I couldn't help but smile and laugh."
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Sheri C.","Spent the afternoon with a friend who suggested we come here for lunch. She told me she had been here before and that I would like it; she was spot on.
Mean Sandwich is a small shop in Ballard that has no frills. Featured in Bon Appetit's 2017 List of America's Best New Restaurants, which I was informed about by my friend, I was intrigued to find a pretty basic menu: 7 sandwiches with 3 daily specials (soup may be one), 1 salad, 3 kinds of fat potato skins: salt & pepper or buffalo sauce or loaded-cheese/chives/bacon bits/more cheese, and yesterday's bun bread pudding.
While my friend and I were staring at the menu trying to decide what to order, a member of BOH came out, started singing loudly along with the 80's song playing and a huge grin. ""What should I get?!"" belted out my friend. ""Buon Appetito,"" he replied. She gushed. He kept singing. She informed me I had to get the skins and share them with her, so we got the salt and pepper.
Buon Appetito is a chicken sandwich with buffalo mayo, provolone, tomato, lettuce, and a pickled pepper relish. It looked huge. It was. My bud ended up taking half the sandwich home for later.
I got the Jersey Sub: capicola, provolone, salami, ham, lettuce, tomato, oregano, oil & vinegar (I asked for no red onion). Amazingly good. Crazy filling. The BREAD, man, the bread. It was like home, only a home I've never had.
Their icon is a pair of lady's lips with red lipstick, and they had free stickers. We each grabbed one. I slapped mine on the back of my day planner which is now in the recycling bin somewhere, and I really, really want to go back and get another sticker. And a sandwich.
You can get delivery. You can get catering. Adult beverages are available. I stuck with a bottle of root beer.
Outdoor seating where your pooch can also sit is available. Tables indoors along with bar stools facing the windows.
Food: 5
Service: 5
Ambiance: 4
Parking: 3 - It's freaking Ballard"
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Brendan c.","I would definitely go back but ratios of sandwiches can be off at times. The guys working there are super nice and the place is spotless. If your lucky to be there when it's open, get a sandwich and if you aren't hungry, get one for later.
Example of poor ratio: is The Fish is really good when you get the right bite and you get a bit of everything. However the sardines are like 10% of the sandwich. The bread is like 40% the sandwich and at times your just eating bread, which is also really good but I want something in between it. Also the fish is between. The lettuce and the slaw so one bite and half of the fish slides right out the back. Next, thing you know your eating a vegan sandwich of slaw and lettuce."
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Scott X.","I have now tried several of the sandwiches...All are delicious but only 3 stars because SMALL...The fillings ie....Chicken Cutlets, Sardines etc...are, no other way to describe it, SKIMPY...I'm from NY where sandwiches at this price point are HUGE and having come here off and on for work for quite a while I can cut them some slack (the food worlds of Ballard and Brooklyn are so far apart as to almost be another country, possibly another planet :-) )...nonetheless for $15 including tax and tip it would be nice to be at the very least full...They are tasty tho'!!!"
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Tom C.","So this review is going to go beyond the incredible sandwiches and touch on the awesome customer experience at Mean Sandwich. We came based on the rumors of a delicious sandwich and were not disappointed. The Mean Corned Beef was awesome. A great version of a staple, including mint to add a touch of sweet flavor. The potato sides were also awesome. The part I really want to highlight though is Dan. When I asked what he recommended, he actually asked questions and gave great guidance. He also checked in on us to see if we were enjoying our sandwiches and asked what we thought of our selections. On our way out the door he thanked us for visiting. I know this all seems minor compared to the food but in today's hipster Seattle food scene I think it's rare to find a spot that not only has great food but also great people that appreciate their customers. Go for the awesome sandwiches, return for the great people!"
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Tori Z.","Very unique signature sandwich. The meat is juicy and delicious and the sandwich is filled with many strong flavored ingredients - and it works. When I saw maple syrup and mint on the menu I thought it was weird, but it really balances the sandwich well. Overall a great sandwich, I'd love to come back to try other sandwiches, the skins and ins, and play corn hole and ping pong in their courtyard."
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Martyn L.","Mean Sandwich is a high quality sandwich place in the south end of Seattle's Ballard. It serves a limited range of well-produced sandwiches.
The restaurant is in an easy location to reach near the bridge. Parking nearby is limited and we were lucky to find a space in relatively short walking distance. We had come for a late lunch so it wasn't too busy.
Inside there is a very limited set of seating. This is a place that probably works best for takeout, since I wouldn't have felt really confident we could sit down, and don't want to let my food get cold. Service was counter-style, and friendly.
The menu is very limited. I knew this going in, but when faced with the actual choices, there are really only two that appeal to me much and really only one I definitely want.
There is a very appealing sounding side (fried potato lumps called skins and ins). This is exactly the sort of thing I typically love, but it was a bit overcooked and oversalted and I liked it but didn't love it, which was the big disappointment of the visit. I had expected this to be the high point.
When the sandwich arrived, it was great quality. I had a Buon Appetito (chicken). The bread is super - which I think is what tends to be most important. Not too sweet or soft. Great bread. The filling was a bit less exciting. It tasted like pretty normal sandwich fare. Not bad in any way, but not amazing. The portions were giant. With the skins, both of us had about twice as much food as we needed for a lunch and should have shared (except that we wanted completely different things).
Overall, this is a pretty good sandwich place. Much better than most of the regular chains or local places. If something from their tiny selection appeals to you, I recommend a visit. I doubt we'll be going very often, because we didn't bond with the choices we made and there isn't much more we want to try."
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Amanda E.","Amazing sandwiches and staff. Ingredients are fresh and prepared to perfection. Much more than an ordinary sandwich . I'll be back!"
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","J B.","Are you in the mood for a really exceptional sandwich experience? Then I highly recommend Mean Sandwich and do get The Mean and an order of fries. The burger is really good. I'm looking forward to trying the other items on the menu and I'm thinking they'll be pretty good. Staff is very friendly (parking can be a bit tough, but there is street parking)."
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","David B.","Nice staff. Cool location.
I think we were oversold on the sandwiches. The hype hurt.
These were solid sandwiches.
The Mean, JCVH and Italian were ok. Nothing stellar. Ironically our veg in the group really loved the falafel sandwich. I agreed and felt a little cheated with my choice of the Italian and the too vinegary sauce and almost Jersey Mike's level of presentation.
I had and have high hopes that some adjustments will help this place live up to the hype like Dingfelders was finally able to do after some adjustments."
"Mean Sandwich","(206) 789-9999","Dominique S.","Such a good Mean Sandwich! I love corned beef and having the MINT was so weird but complimented the other flavors so well!!!! Huge success. The owner and his brother were so welcoming. And the POTATO crisps!!!! Wow so good! Best part was the funny cat videos playing on the Tv inside. Just kidding the best part was the Jaw dropping bread pudding. Such a cool place and felt so welcoming."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Karrissa D.","I called this evening to verify their cacio e pepe is vegetarian, and it is! yay!
I ordered the cacio e pepe and a slice of sourdough bread through uber eats. The flavor of the cacio e pepe is quite different from what I've had before, I think it's the aged cheese that really made the difference. It was delicious though! The pasta was perfectly cooked (& fresh!) and the 'sauce' still had a really good pepper flavor. The sourdough also came with a light drizzle of olive oil and salt which complemented the pasta perfectly.
Only downside was the temperature, but that's a given with delivery. Definitely looking forward to being able to visit once everything is back open, as this was my first time trying their food. I'm for sure going to order some fresh pasta for home in the future too."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Andrea O.","Even in these challenging times (covid-19 lockdown) these guys are rocking it. They reconfigured the restaurant for to go/delivery only orders. Got my usual favorites to go and everything was amazing. Will keep supporting them during this difficult moment, consider doing the same!"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Becca H.","Due' Cucina is a great spot for lunch or dinner! The prices are great, the servers and atmosphere are relaxed and welcoming, and the food is amazing. My go-to order is the Traditional Bolognese Ragu with traditional spaghetti. My boyfriend orders the Aglio & Olio with healthy campanelle and adds fried tofu. Be sure to get tiramisu, sharing is an option size-wise, but you won't want to. It's to die for! We placed an order for pick-up today since the city is still under the stay-at-home order. There was no fuss and no wait to get our food. We're going to continue supporting Dué through the coronavirus pandemic and beyond. Yum!!!"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Jen H.","Thank goodness this place delivers all the way to Kirkland! I miss eating out in Seattle so I was super thankful and appreciative that we were in the delivery area.
I ordered the kale pesto campanelle and it was amazing!! I would definitely order this again. It was cooked perfectly - nice and chewy. My partner ordered the eggplant parm and he was a little disappointed with the portion size; it came in a tiny little box. He was jealous of my kale pesto pasta which I hesitantly shared with him. We shared the tiramisu at the end of our meal and it was fantastic, one of the best tiramisu I have had in awhile. Definitely planning on ordering here more while this pandemic is going on. Highly recommend!"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Richard U.","3.5 star place!
Interesting casual dining pasta place up in Cap Hill. I was looking to support local restaurants still open during the shelter at home mandate in effect and luckily they are still open for take out.
Stuff tried:
Eggplant parmesan: i am only person i know that actually craves eggplant parm. The version here is not crispy at all but it is exceedingly delicious! My only gripe is that the portion size is tiny. If you are remotely hungry i would order two servings.
Mushroom with truffle oil on healthy pasta: i am a sucker for mushroom truffle oil anything. Chose the healthy pasta which is made from some type of bean flour instead of wheat giving it a toothy consistency. The pasta has touted health benefits but the consistency might be offputting for some folks. Flavor was pretty good however
Bruschetta caprese: nice slab of grilled bread with fresh toppings. I admit that the to go version seems to have left my bruschetta a bit soggy. Eat this first next time"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Holly L.","The pasta was very tasty! Excellent. If I had eaten on-site, I'd probably rate higher. I love that you can really taste the truffle oil in the mushroom pasta dish. The pomodoro was simple but hit the spot.
However, I ordered delivery through Yelp/Grub Hub and it was an awful wait. On yelp, it said 30-50 min wait time. However I waited 1.5 hours or 40 mins to 1 hour more wait time than I expected. I was tired and hadn't eaten for more than 9 hours so I picked the place that could be the least amount of wait. The restaurant blamed the grub hub driver, and when I called grub hub they weren't taking calls. After my 3rd call to grub hub, they also blamed the driver and gave me a lousy 10% discount for my next purchase.
I'd probably eat here again but NEVER use delivery."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Marie B.","I love pasta and have been to just about every Italian spot in Seattle. Handmade pasta, I'm there! Pasta in a casual setting, even better! Most often though, I don't have access to the likes of Il Corvo, Pasta Casalinga, G.H. Pasta, Ristorante Machiavelli, Tavolata, or La Vita e Bella because I currently don't work in Seattle.
However, the very first Yelper I ever met is credited for the recommendation to Due' Cucina Italiana *Bryan K* Clearly, I had been under a rock and late to the pasta bowl party at this popular Capitol Hill/Broadway spot. I've interacted with the two brothers than run DCI, great charismatic business owners. Brilliant concept and business hours until 2200! Great counter staff and efficient kitchen crew. A variety of seating are available whether dining solo, pairs or larger groups. Just remember to kindly bus your table at the end!
My first visit was back in December 2018 (been open since October 2016!) and have been back so many times that honestly I've lost count. This is a long overdue Yelp review as I just had a custom pasta bowl for dunch/linner hours ago (1/27/20).
Assorted fresh pasta that's crafted on site. Your pasta bowl is customized by selecting type of pasta, sauce, and other ingredients from the giant wall signage. Order and pay at the counter, then find a place to sit if dining onsite. There's also brisk takeout and delivery traffic.
In about 15-20 minutes your name is called or check the status on the order monitor. I like to admire my pasta bowl and then dig in while nice and hot. Feeling raveneous, one can easily polish off a bowl. Most often, I have tasty leftovers for another meal.
Another item I've had often (but not today) is their delicious tiramisu. Enough to share, or not!
So thank you Bryan K, Due' Cucina Italiana has become one of my regular spots.
High quality, delicious, affordable, satisfying, highly recommended!"

"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Julia L.","Had a lovely lunch here recently! The place is modern, clean, well lit (large windows) with plenty of open seating. Remember to seat yourself & bus your own table. My group tried a variety of the sauces...
- traditional bolognese: rich, hearty, filling
- cacio & pepe: the cheese flavor was very sharp and strong, delicious but a bit too much for me
- amatriciana: lots of tomato flavors + smokey, savory goodness in the form of guanciale (cured pork cheek)
- mushroom & white truffle oil: creamy, thick, but not too heavy. Wonder, well balanced flavors between the mushroom and truffle oil (personal favorite out of the 4 sauces)
The pastas were all fresh and perfectly al dente (firm, chewy). Personally enjoyed the rigatoni and ca campanelle best. Would recommend and come back again!"

----
Every time I go to @duecucina I become more and more of a fan. It's a place that has definitely grown on me. The pastas are light, more my style for lunch, and very very fresh!

My favorite at the moment would be the mushroom sauce. Simple and yet the umami really shines through. What do you get here?"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Edward A.","Friendly staff, in a way. I was told the order line starts near the entrance. I thought i had to order at the food pickup area. Oops.
I had eggplant parmesan. Pretty tasty little appetizer dish. My wife had the only pasta dish that was rated high on the al dente-ish. Those noodles were rather undercooked. Felt like i was eating them raw. But i guess thats what it is by definition? I can definitely see the appeal."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Yvonne Yiyao X.","Can't believe it took me so long to find this place. Friendly service. Reasonably priced. Food is fast and fresh. Delicious sauce. Pasta is al dente. I loved both pasta dishes and the tiramisu. I see their take out orders coming out rapidly. The store is not super busy or overwhelming. The owner actually cares about his business and was cleaning up here and there. The kitchen is bright and clean - always a good thing to be able to see the kitchen.
Four stars but only because of my love to Il Corvo. This is a place I'll certainly come back soon."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Cristina G.","I have ordered this twice to be delivered to my office using uber eats. This is the best italian pasta I have eaten in Seattle with the exception of Barolo. The pasta is definitely made freshly from scratch and cooked perfectly al dente chewy.
My favorite dish is the mushroom and truffle oil pasta The first time, i went with another reviewer's suggestion and added pork. I decided I liked it better without pork since pork was flavorful but a little greasy.
Last time I ordered a pasta with another type of ragu and it was also great but needing cheese. Make sure you request extra cheese if you order this pasta.
I would pass on ordering any of the breads."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Brianna F.","We came here on a Thursday evening for a double date to celebrate a couple birthdays and it was packed! Due Cucina Italiana is an order-upon-entry, seat-yourself, and bus-your-own-table establishment. Luckily our friends had arrived earlier than us and were able to snag a table.
The ordering steps are as follows: choose a sauce, choose a pasta, order add-ons or drinks if wanted, sit and watch the screen until your order is ready.
Holy guacamole this place is good! Although the rest of my party ordered the bolognese ragu, I decided on the mushroom and white truffle oil sauce with campanelle pasta and pork sausage. The wait for our food was about 15 minutes, but the food is freshly prepared after your order is placed. The portions are extremely generous for the price, and it's very obvious that the pasta is fresh and perfectly al dente.
I will definitely be back to try the other sauce and pasta options. AND DESSERTS! ;)"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Derek H.","AMBIANCE
I'm a huge fan of white tile on white grout walls because it really brightens up the place. The servers are super friendly and nice. Food came out in less than ten minutes. It's cool to see all the pasta being made behind the counter. The place is really clean.
FOOD
We went with the Mushroom and White Truffle Oil with Pork Sausage and the Traditional Bolognese both with their recommended pastas. You could definitely taste the freshness of the pasta (not that I had any doubt because they literally make it behind the counter). The noodles had a great bounce, while still remaining a perfect al dente.
The sauces were great, but honestly just didn't fit my preferred palette. Completely a personal thing. The wine hints in the bolognese were too pronounced for my liking. I prefer a meatier and drier bolognese. It was hard to taste the truffle in the other dish. Then again it's $13, you can't expect much. I would have preferred more cream, but again, it's just personal preference!
OVERALL
Great vibe, I love being able to choose different sauces and noodles. I'd come back if I was in the area for a different dish."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Monica L.","I'm not a pasta lover whatsoever. I eat pasta maybe once or twice a year. But I about licked my plate and my friend's plate. Holy moly. I couldn't get enough of my lasagna and her campanelle.
The staff is super friendly too. You pick up your food, grab your own water, and bus your own table. You have to go up to the counter to order too. There's no waiter but nobody cares because the pasta is out of this world.
It's too bad I don't live right above the building. I'm now a total convert."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Tracy C.","This was one of the most highly rated restaurants in Capitol Hill so I had very high expectations but I was disappointed. I got the traditional bolognese and I was expecting it to have lots of sauce and flavour but the toppings tasted off and it was too dry. My pasta also took a long time to prepare compared to my friends so I thought it would be super fresh but it wasn't at all. I recommend skipping this restaurant if you're looking for Italian food."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Jen L.","My biggest complaint is that our pastas were NOT hot. It was a warm, but not close to hot! Lasagna was hot. We were waiting at the counter before they even called my name since I saw we were next up.
- Mushroom and white truffle with added pork sausage. This was our favorite. My sister's bowl had more sauce than ours, which I think is better as ours was a bit dry. What's with the inconsistency?
-Smoked salmon spaghetti: as you can see from my photo we had very little salmon compared to other customers' photos and the restaurant website's photos. WTH?! It was mostly noodles with a few piece of salmon and a pile of greens. Totally not what everyone else's pics look like.
- Lasagna Bolognese: I've definitely had better. Would probably choose the regular bolognese pasta over this.
- bell pepper bruschetta: too salty, but a nice change from a regular caprese
- tiramisu: delicious!
Pros: fresh pastas are cooked to perfection. Price is on point.
They do not take reservations. You order at the cashier, and then wait for them to call your name. It's really loud inside so there's board that tells you when they are ready for you to come up to the counter to get your food to carry back to your table. And the bowls/plates are heavy. You have to get your own water in the back. Also you are required to bus your own table. So what exactly did I add a tip for? I guess I should have read the other reviews. Maybe that's how they keep their prices reasonable. I was so excited to come here after being in Italy 1 month ago, and chose this restaurant for a night out with friends. With the inconsistency of salmon portion (and mushroom sauce), and failure of the proper temp of the pasta, I feel disappointed."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","Melody Y.","Oh my goodness the food is absolutely incredible here! The pasta is fresh, cooked to al dante perfection, and tasted amazing. I love how they offer sublime quality Italian dishes in a casual environment.
Being from Vancouver, I never thought there'd be a place like this. Wanting Italian food always means paying significantly more for a fine dining experience. Not only is Due Cucina super casual, but the prices are also affordable as well. I highly recommend adding a poached egg to your pasta! Elevates the experience to a whole other level."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","(206) 397-4375","chara c.","Disappointing. The pasta dough is homemade but machine-worked and the gluten is clearly not worked long enough because it has no chew or ""bite"" to it. My plate of pasta was also undercooked and tough. The sauces were mostly good, except the Amatriciana was a too salty and way too much cheese it was overpowering. It was more casual than expected but that was just fine, as orders were at the front and you picked up your own food. Came out pretty quickly and it wasnt too busy during weekday lunch."
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Sarah M.","Yummy, with big portions. Had takeout during the Covid epidemic, and during this time they are offering 20% off to go orders -- even for wine. I can only imagine how it would be even better for a sit down visit and can't wait for the chance to go back during better times."
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Dan T.","We ordered takeout yesterday due to the quarantine of the city. The food was absolutely delicious. Some of the best Italian food we have ever had and so welcome during these challenging times. Chef Antolin is the best at his craft.
We will definitely be calling in another order soon. For everyone who wants a truly first class meal please support this restaurant and their staff.
Thank you for making our dinner and evening so enjoyable at home."
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Mike V.","Why are these restaurants only in Seattle?
It's as if all these great chefs slaved away in the industry for years, and one day woke up and said, you know what? I'm going to buy a small place, house, bottom floor of a building with three chiropractic offices, and just run my own small kitchen where I can float casually between the pan my guests tables, regaling them with stories of my cooking career and adventures, all the while wowing them with absolutely incredible dishes.
What Zouave is for Italian with a hint of southern French flair, Pomodoro is for Italian with a decidedly Spanish/Mediterranean coastline lean.
The chef knocks it out of the park every time we go here, and the service in largely impeccable, but more so when the chef is hanging around your table.
Outside of traveling abroad, we rarely do a full bottle of wine at dinner in the US, as dinners are often so rushed. Not here. And we always take the chefs recommendation on a bottle once we've decided which of his incredible meals we will take on for the evening.
My personal favorites are the Capellini with the fresh dungeness crab (insanely good) and the puttanesca with prawns. And yes, you should absolutely take the chefs recommended additional spice from his special habanero olive oil that you've read about, or if you're lucky and he has it, his secret truffle oil.
We have two places we go every week or two in Seattle, Canon for drinks and dinner, and Pomodoro for the slightly early dinner on weekends, especially rainy ones where you want nothing more than comfort food, smiles and great red wine."
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","David P.","Honestly, I think Pomodoro is the best Italian restaurant in Seattle. I've been to fancier places in Seattle, to cheaper places, but the food and people at Pomodoro are second to none.
I used to live in Boston where I was lucky to have experienced authentic Italian food in the North End area of the city. Being able to get home-y Italian food is one of the things I miss the most about Boston and Pomodoro fills that void for me.
The food is no frills, just good food. The owners and staff are genuine and warm. We would highly recommend checking out Pomodoro!"
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Chris A.","A chef that's cooked for the King of Spain? Sign me up... xD
I've been living in Seattle for almost 10 years and Pomodoro continues to be one of my go to spots for visitors and for when I want to treat myself! Prices are very reasonable and the food and service is amazing.
Pomodoro is an awesome mixture of Spanish Basque and Italian. I've been numerous times, always ordered something new, and have always enjoyed my meal. Also can someone figure out what is in that avocado pesto that is brought to every table? Its so GOOD! xD."
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Thao N.","First of all, happy birthday to one of my best friend, Jordan!!!
She's the reason why we discovered this restaurant since I never have a reason to be around this Eastlake neighborhood. The restaurant is super cute, small, and intimate, good thing we had a reservation. Food is great, my angel hair pasta just melts in my mouth. I ordered no shrimp because I don't eat seafood and they offered to replace it with mushrooms, wasn't even expecting a replacement. Everybody's food looked so good too, it was freshly made as you can see the hot steam coming in the air while everybody is eating. Service was excellent considering we did came in a large group. They even came outside to take a group photo for us which you already know, it's time consuming when it's all girls xD
There's unlimited bread as appetizers, be careful or you might actually get too full before your entree comes out. Love this place, nice enough for date nights/special occasions and cozy enough if you casually just want some good Italian food for dinner. I hate cooking, good thing I didn't have to last night.
Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Nicole A.","I was scrambling to find a place for dinner for 5 people on a Friday night, and luckily Pomodoro came the the rescue! It's a smaller restaurant that has a very intimate vibe with dim lighting and a partially open kitchen.
To start we shared two tapas: the ravioli with hummus and truffle, and the calamari. Of the two, I preferred the calamari. The squid tasted fresh and it was sautéed squid rather than breaded and deep fried squid, which was a pleasant change. In comparison the ravioli was a bit too rich and heavy.
For my entree I opted for the paella and I was happy with my choice! The amount of seafood was abundant and the presentation was pretty. I also enjoyed the seasonings and it was cooked well. The only suggestion I would have would be to get a bit more of a crispy layer in the skillet. The rice seemed like it was cooked into a larger batch and then served in the skillet they brought me, so I was missing the slightly crunchy and smoky bits I love in paella. After a while, the texture can be a bit one-note without them."
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Janhavi B.","Pomodoro is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in Seattle. There are fancier ones, but the food and service here are is unparalleled. I would say that Pomodoro is pricier than some others (e.g. Ristorante Machiavelli) but it more than makes up with the personal touch and the fact that you can get a table way more easily! Located on the relatively quiet Eastlake Avenue - it's almost easy to miss, but their handmade pastas, and dessert (tiramisu and creme brulee) are a must-try. Almost every pasta and special I have tried so far has been delicious so I can't recommend anything specific but highlight recommend a visit here! With 1 entree per person, a dessert and a bottle of wine, it may end up costing you close to $40-50 a pop."
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Jordan N.","I've been here two times already and both times have been amazing! They have free parking behind the restaurant and can make​ reservations online for big parties in advance.
Both times I ordered the Linguine alla Carbonara con Pancetta, which has pork belly and ​light cream. It was very delicious and satisfying to my stomach! Normally I feel so bloated after eating pasta but I ate the whole damn thing! I also had a malbec (red wine) to complement my pasta. There's also a bread appetizer served with some cilantro butter, so yummy!
Last night I came here for my birthday dinner and the staff brought out a tiramisu cake with a candle. The cake was rich in coffee flavor. The staff was also patient with our large party and even split up our checks and took a picture for us!
I love coming here and would love to try new things on their menu when I have another chance. Highly recommended to those who love Italian and Spanish dishes."
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Jacqueline H.","Came here for a friend's birthday and had a great meal! The restaurant is in a quiet area of Eastlake and is pretty low key. The chef walks around and takes your order and provides some great recommendations. We ordered the portobello mushrooms and octopus as appetizers. Both were delicious! They also bring you bread that comes with a side of pesto - love when Italian restaurants give pesto instead of bread or olive oil!
For the entrees, we ordered the Gnocchi con Salsiccia e Funghi, paella, and Capellini al Aglio con Polpa di Grancio e Tartufo. The paella was really good and came with a good variety of seafood (calamari, mussels, shrimp) and wasn't overly greasy. The capellini was delicious! I loved the crab meat and truffle oil. The gnocchi was good as well, but my least favorite out of the 3. Additionally we tried their tiramisu and it was amazing! Overall, a great Italian restaurant that is super low key but has delicious food. Highly recommend!"
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Heidi L.","I was looking for a nice date night spot for my boyfriend and I since we were craving Italian food for our anniversary. The restaurant wasn't too busy at the time we came in. The chef, himself stopped by our table asking how our food was, he then recommended a spicy oil that would go well with my special pasta. I love spicy food so that was a pleasant experience and it complimented the food well. Both the pasta dishes were filled with flavor and just danced in our taste pallet. It had us talking about it for the rest of the evening haha. I would definitely comeback for another date night!"
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Lynden L.","My dining experience at Pomodoro was as a part of a large-party. For those interested in making a large party reservation, they will typically require you to book a time earlier than their normal dinner hours and charge a late/overtime fee if your group shows up late or stays beyond the allocated time.
The service was very friendly throughout the evening and as they were prepared for our party, servers were very prompt as well. They quickly took everyone's individual pasta orders as they sat down and served the caesar salad shortly after. The dressing on the caesar was very flavorful and was not too salty or heavy. It did seem like the lettuce had been sitting in the dressing for a while though-- this might not be an issue with a regular dining experience.
I ordered the Penne alla Vodka, which I believe was the best dish out of the pre-selected options we were given. It was the perfect balance between creamy and tangy. There could've been a bit more sausage or veggies to mix up the texture though. I also had a bite of the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto con Linguine pasta, which was alright, but felt like it was missing a certain 'oomph'. Perhaps some extra spice or citrus (lemon squeeze?) would really brighten it up. The prawns served with the dish were very plump and fresh though!
The tiramisu was average-- we did notice that each piece seemed to have a different flavor profile (more chocolatey, more alcoholic, more coffee) so there was a lack of consistency but the taste was fine."
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Jun Li Z.","Came here on a date in October 2018. The pasta dishes are great and I recall the service was really good. I recommend coming here on dates or with a friend. The atmosphere is quite chill, low lighting which can be romantic or hard for your partner to see the menu ;)"
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Amanda I.","I came to Pomodoro the night after an interview to reward myself and unwind a bit. I ordered the Dungeness crab angel hair pasta special and loved it. Though it was pricey, there was a good amount of crab. I believe it also had some black truffles which added great flavor to the simple butter garlic sauce. They also offer a spicy sauce to drizzle on top and I would highly recommend it. It is a bit spicy so maybe ask to try a little on the side first.
For dessert I got the creme brûlée. This is perhaps one of my favorite dessert dishes so I couldn't resist. I was somewhat disappointed. Instead of the creamy center it usually has, this one was much firmer. The flavor was good but the texture was certainly off. The top tasted like a toasted marshmallow which, again, is not quite what one typically looks for in a creme brûlée. But it was good and I ate it up. However for $9 it is definitely not worth the price.
Service here is really good. The owner is very friendly and chatted to me a little about my trip to Seattle. Other employees were very efficient and friendly as well. The check did feel a little rushed at the end but otherwise the service was great!
If you're looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion this would be a really good option. The food is a little pricier but it is delicious. The ambiance creates a more upscale feel and the service is on point."
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Sloan C.","Went there last Friday night. Although I was late for my reservation, they were nice enough to find a table for me and my friend. Food was great. Ordered linguine with cream and anise sauce and shrimp. The sauce was balanced - flavorful yet not too heavy. The pasta was topped with some grapes, which I found interesting. I also ordered ab octopus side and it was soooo tender. Would definitely come back again to try other items from the menu!"
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Annalise W.","Love this place. Perfect little neighborhood Italian restaurant. Ideal for date nights, celebrating, or if you're just craving some delicious Italian food. Romantic, intimate, and homey vibe.
Portion sizes are generous and food is always consistently delicious. I love their caesar salad. I always get the same entree, the chicken breast with gorgonzola sauce and pasta with red sauce. It's absolutely amazing! Chicken is tender and juicy. I always have a hard time deciding if I want a creamy white sauce or a zesty tomato sauce and I love this dish because I get the best of both worlds. The chicken is covered in a creamy gorgonzola and the pasta is in a light tomato sauce. Portion size is very generous. They also have a house made chili oil that you can ask for on your pasta. It's too spicy for me, but if you love some heat I recommend. I have also ordered the carbonara, which I recommend. I also highly recommend the tiramisu.
Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city! There is also a free covered parking garage that is super convenient."
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Alex O.","Best fettuccine Alfredo hands down. At least for me. I don't know why but it has such an interesting taste. Different from all the other Alfredo dishes I've had. I just want to eat more and more. It has a Spanish twist to it. If you order it's Polla al Jerez. The tiramisu is also heavenly. I need to stop trying the other desserts and just stick with this one.
The snow crab pasta is also exceptionally good. I need to get this one again. If only I could eat pasta everyday."
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Artemis L.","I am giving this restaurant five stars despite a couple of unsettling experiences with our waiter. The food is just that good.
My husband took me out to dinner at Pomodoro last night to celebrate my birthday. It is a lovely little restaurant, with creative lighting (red circle lights, tiny twinkling white lights, and warm yellowish-white lights), and crisp white tablecloths.
I had the tomato cream soup, the paella, and I split the dungeness crab linguine with my husband. My husband also had the pork pancetta. My husband is characteristially very unenthusiastic, so when I asked him how his food was and he said ""good"" (he says ""okay"" 95%+ of the time that I ask him this question), I knew that the food was an unusually special experience for him, too!
My food was absolutely outstanding, probably among the top ten meals I've ever eaten. The chef had a lovely long blurb included in the menu about his love for cooking, a few of his famous customers, and his experience as a chef. While I enjoyed reading this blurb, I definitely judged the food on my actual experience of eating it, which was heavenly.
We also ordered a bottle of the Cava Mont Marcal wine. I enthusiastically recommend this wine. It was outstanding.
Our waiter has a very genteel manner, but his memory and attentiveness are unfortunately severely lacking. We arrived fairly late, just after 9pm, and perhaps he'd had a long and busy night before we arrived. He also appeared to be pushing 90 years old.
He smiled a lot and he seemed like he was trying his best, but he basically ignored us for the middle half of our meal. My husband had to literally get up out of his chair three times to go up to him when we needed something. He was just in his own world (also I think partially closing the restaurant, but we just couldn't get his attention for several minutes on end after several tries).
He was respectful and sweet when he did get to us, however, he also brought up four very serious and upsetting topics (communism, genocide, global warming, and immigration), all of which I deeply care about, however, I would prefer very much to focus on lighter, more pleasant conversational topics while eating a celebratory birthday dinner. It was an odd experience - I must say I've actually never had a waiter bring up such topics when dining out.
At the start of our meal, I informed the waiter that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition which gluten can aggravate terribly. I was happy to see that there are gluten-free options for many of the dishes, which I requested. He seemed to really listen to that, which is important to me, and I did not flare with my condition after eating my meal.
However, at the end of the night, he brought me out a surprise piece of tiramisu with a flaming birthday candle on it. He had a huge smile on his face and he looked so excited, and I was delighted! However, when he put the piece of tiramisu in front of me I had a scared feeling for a second and asked him, ""Is this gluten-free?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""I can't eat it then, can you please take it away?"" He said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" I said, ""Yes, you did know, because I told you at the beginning of the meal that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition."" He said again, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" To be honest, the apology seemed genuine. He seems like a nice person. But it's a little scary that he completely forgot something that could have caused me serious pain.
But then he said, ""well, your husband can eat it then."" I said, ""My husband will not be eating birthday cake in front of me on my birthday that I am not able to eat."" He offered me Spumoni or coffee on the house. I declined.
I feel like he was really trying to make things right, I think he just wasn't getting it. I got upset and asked my husband to pay for our meals and asked my husband to leave a 20% tip to be polite (I usually tip between 23% - 27%). I left the restaurant and waited for my husband in the car while he paid. I feel like the waiter does embody the spirit of service that I look for when I dine out, despite the unsettling errors on his part.
Recommended, but if you are gluten-free maybe double-check more than you usually would. This food is absolutely stunning."
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Jacey H.","Yes, yes, yes. Great service, cozy little atmosphere. Not pretentious. Everything was perfect."
"Pomodoro","(206) 324-3160","Michael G.","Excellent all around.
We came on a Friday night. Many open tables, but they were committed to upcoming diners, so we were seated at the bar. Our good luck since we got to chat up many people behind the bar.
Interesting menu choices, tapas, full dishes, that start traditional Italian but also have a Spanish twist to many items.
We had veal marsala and vodka penne. The marsala was particularly adventurous. Great wine by the glass choices.
Tiramisu is a have-to-have. Eastlake should be proud to have this in their neighborhood!"
